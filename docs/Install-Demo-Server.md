# Trustroots Demo Server Setup
This setup procedure is based on Server.md with Passenger as part of the setup. This was written to help create a federated hospitality system under the Open Hospitality Network project.

## System Setup
Ubuntu 18.04 server with 2gb RAM (4gb recommended for development). Non-root user below is called dsterry.

Run the following commands to setup a user and login via ssh from that user, just as you can to root (if keys were added during OS install by the host)
Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/initial-server-setup-with-ubuntu-18-04

```
adduser dsterry
usermod -aG sudo dsterry
ufw allow OpenSSH
ufw enable
rsync --archive --chown=dsterry:dsterry ~/.ssh /home/dsterry
```

Log out from root and log back in with the non-root user.

### Install Nginx
Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-nginx-on-ubuntu-18-04

```
sudo apt install nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
```

### Passenger
Now we setup Passenger by running these commands one at a time.
Source: https://www.phusionpassenger.com/library/install/nginx/install/oss/bionic/

```
sudo apt-get install -y dirmngr gnupg
sudo apt-key adv --keyserver hkp://keyserver.ubuntu.com:80 --recv-keys 561F9B9CAC40B2F7
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y apt-transport-https ca-certificates
sudo sh -c 'echo deb https://oss-binaries.phusionpassenger.com/apt/passenger bionic main > /etc/apt/sources.list.d/passenger.list'
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libnginx-mod-http-passenger
```

`if [ ! -f /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-passenger.conf ]; then sudo ln -s /usr/share/nginx/modules-available/mod-http-passenger.load /etc/nginx/modules-enabled/50-mod-http-passenger.conf ; fi`

`sudo ls /etc/nginx/conf.d/mod-http-passenger.conf`

And you should see a file listed there. If not, make an issue in the fedi-trustroots repo.

```
sudo service nginx restart
sudo /usr/bin/passenger-config validate-install
```

If there are any errors, follow the onscreen directions.

`sudo /usr/sbin/passenger-memory-stats`

And you should see some nginx and Passenger processes. If not, something is wrong.

Replace subdomain.example.com with your domain and do the following to create a server block for your domain.

```
export DOMAIN=subdomain.example.com
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/$DOMAIN/html
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/$DOMAIN/html
sudo mkdir -p /var/www/$DOMAIN/ft
sudo chown -R $USER:$USER /var/www/$DOMAIN/ft
sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/$DOMAIN
nano /var/www/$DOMAIN/html/index.html
```

The last line opens a file, paste in the following html and save it.

```
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Welcome to Example.com!</title>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>Success! The example.com server block is working!</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```

The next line opens a file. Paste in the configuration that follows, swap your domain in for example.com in three places and save the file.

`sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/$DOMAIN`

```
server {
        listen 80;
        listen [::]:80;

        root /var/www/example.com/html;
        index index.html index.htm index.nginx-debian.html;

        server_name example.com www.example.com;

        location / {
                try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
        }
}
```

```
sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/$DOMAIN /etc/nginx/sites-enabled/
sudo nano /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
```

Remove the # to uncomment the line that says `server_names_hash_bucket_size 64;`

Test your nginx config with
`sudo nginx -t`

Check the result to make sure your config is ok, then

`sudo systemctl restart nginx`

Add the following at the top of the http section of /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

```
    ##
    # Passenger for Fedi-trustroots
    ## 

    # passenger_ruby /usr/bin/passenger_free_ruby;
    passenger_nodejs /usr/local/bin/node;
    passenger_show_version_in_header off;
```

### SSL
Next we’ll enable SSL using a Let’s Encrypt certificate. When prompted by the last command, choose Redirect for better security.
Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-nginx-with-let-s-encrypt-on-ubuntu-18-04
Note: This ppa method is deprecated in 18.04.5 LTS so you’ll have to hit enter to add it.

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot
sudo apt install python-certbot-nginx
sudo ufw allow 'Nginx Full'
sudo ufw delete allow 'Nginx HTTP'
sudo certbot --nginx -d $DOMAIN -d www.$DOMAIN
```

### Install MongoDB
Source: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-mongodb-on-ubuntu-18-04-source

`curl -fsSL https://www.mongodb.org/static/pgp/server-4.4.asc | sudo apt-key add -`

`echo "deb [ arch=amd64,arm64 ] https://repo.mongodb.org/apt/ubuntu bionic/mongodb-org/4.4 multiverse" | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/mongodb-org-4.4.list`

Continuing setup per https://team.trustroots.org/Install.html

```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install mongodb-org
sudo systemctl start mongod.service
sudo systemctl enable mongod
```

For production it is also recommended to further secure mongodb as described here: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-secure-mongodb-on-ubuntu-18-04

### Install nvm 
Install nvm from the nvm-sh repo. It’s good practice to visit the repo and make sure there are no security incidents that might have compromised this script.
Source: https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.38.0/install.sh | bash`

Log out and log back in to enable nvm and then install node.

`nvm install node 16`

### Clone and configure the repo 
Next clone the repo.
`git clone https://github.com/OpenHospitalityNetwork/fedi-trustroots.git /var/www/$DOMAIN/ft`

Add `port: 3001,` to `config/env/production.js` because webpack:server proxies from port 3000 to 3001.

### Setup smtp service
You can use for example SparkPost (EU)
https://app.eu.sparkpost.com

In SparkPost Configuration, add a sending domain. We use strict alignment subdomain, which means `mail.refugees.openHospitality.network` as both sending and bounce domains. You'll need to add `TXT` and `CNAME` records for the domain to your DNS.

Create an API key for SparkPost and store it in the env variable:

`export SPARKPOST_API_KEY=<your api key>`

Configure mailer in `config/env/production.js`

```
  mailer: {
    from: 'hello@mail.refugees.openHospitality.network',
    options: {
      host: 'smtp.eu.sparkpostmail.com',
      port: 587,
      secure: false,
      auth: {
        user: 'SMTP_Injection',
        pass: process.env.SPARKPOST_API_KEY,
      },
    },
  },
```

## Build and run

Install dependencies, etc. This is the part that requires 4gb of ram. 

```
sudo apt install make build-essential
npm ci
```

Compare your nginx config to this one and make any necessary changes: https://gist.github.com/weex/add4a96da52be1ca32e9698ce713b366

```
sudo nginx -t
sudo systemctl restart nginx
```

Run this command to build assets.
`NODE_ENV=production npm run build`

Then run these three in separate shells.
```
NODE_ENV=production npm run start:prod
NODE_ENV=production npm run webpack:server
NODE_ENV=production npm run start:worker:prod
```

At this point you should be able to visit the site!

If you have any problems while following this procedure, please make an issue at fedi-trustroots.
